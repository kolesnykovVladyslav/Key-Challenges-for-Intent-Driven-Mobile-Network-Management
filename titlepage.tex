    Intent-Driven Networking (IDN) is a promising concept that tends to automate conventional networking by applying a deeper level of intelligence. High-level intents offer an efficient and powerful way of expressing network requirements to manage its infrastructure, resources, and services without providing exact configurations. This paper surveys the main challenges of applying IDN in mobile networks. We clarify the definition of IDN, present a generic architecture and briefly cover an intent translation process. We also discuss the current research status of IDN and present its clear advantages over regular networking.
