    Intent-Driven Networking (IDN) is a promising concept that tends to automate conventional networking by applying a deeper level of intelligence. High-level intents offer an efficient and powerful way of expressing network requirements to manage its infrastructure, resources, and services without providing exact configurations. This paper provides an overview of the main challenges in applying IDN in mobile networks. It clarifies the definition of IDN, presents a generic architecture, and briefly covers an intent translation process. We also discuss available industrial products based on this concept and present the advantages of IDN over traditional networking.
