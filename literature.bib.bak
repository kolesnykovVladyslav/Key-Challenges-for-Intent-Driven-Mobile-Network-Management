  abstract     = {Intent-Based Networks (IBNs), which are originally proposed to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, can effectively solve the challenges of traditional networks in terms of efficiency, flexibility, and security. IBNs are mainly used to transform users’ business intent into network configuration, operation, and maintenance strategies, which are prominent for designing the AI-enabled 6G networks. In particular, in order to meet the massive, intelligent service demands and overcome the time-varying radio propagation, IBNs can continuously learn and adapt to the time-varying network environment based on the massive collected network data in real-time. From the aspects of both the core network and radio access network, this article comprehensively surveys the architectures and key techniques of IBNs for 6G. In particular, the demonstration platforms of IBNs, such as the Apstra Operating System, Forward Networks Verification Platform, and One Convergence Service Interaction Platform, are presented. Moreover, the industrial development of IBNs is elaborated, including the emerging new products and startups to solve the problems of open data platforms, automated network operations, and preemptive network fault diagnosis. Finally, several open issues and challenges are identified as well to spur future researches.},

  abstract     = {Globally distributed scientific experiments involve movement of massive data volumes and many collaborators performing distributed data analysis. With complex workloads and heterogeneous resources, each user may desire certain behavior characteristics for their network paths. In this paper, we present the iNDIRA tool, which interacts with SDN north-bound interfaces to enable intent-based networking. It provides reliable, simple, and technology-agnostic communication between users and networks. Focusing particularly on science applications, iNDIRA uses natural language processing to construct semantic RDF graphs to understand, interact, and create the required network services. The technical challenges addressed by iNDIRA are: (1) development of a high-level descriptive language to query network-application requirements, (2) provides keyword identification and condition checking based on user profiles and topology details, (3) allows user negotiation based on the current network state, and (4) integrates network provisioning and service tools used by the application. iNDIRA is implemented on the ESnet network, where it interacts with OpenNSA (aka the NSI client) and Globus data transfer tools, to build complex cross-domain network paths for heterogeneous science applications, and perform secure data transfer. We argue that iNDIRA’s approach presents users with an alternative approach to interact and communicate their network demands, allowing seamless network service integration.},
